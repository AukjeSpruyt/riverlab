Feature development
===========================

In this tutorial we are going to add the roughness formula of Järvelä (2004) and Västilä & Järvelä (2017) to the Delft3D FM source code. We will then build a model which is subsequently tested against experimental data, to test whether our implementation was done correctly. Finally, we prepare a validation document detailing both our proposed new feature and validation results, which will be submitted for review by Deltares. 
If the new feature was correctly implemented, does not break other functionality and is well validated, the new feature will be implemented in the main ....

Steps
---------------------------
 #. Download the source code
 #. Modify the source code
 #. Prepare validation test 
 #. Submit changes for review
